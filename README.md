<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Bytes Counter Shot][product-screenshot]](https://makingdevices.com/Bytes-Counter)

Bytes Counter is a simple Tally Counter for counting people in places, helping you in inventories, practising soldering or just counting things at work! The project was chosen to test some PCB manufacturer capabilities and experiment with both the XLP (Extreme Low-Power Technology) and the pic18LF14k50 itself

The PCB does not have any power button, since the project's approach is to use the XLP technology of the PIC. It only has two buttons: increase/decrease the count.

A buzzer helps you count anything without needing to read the display every time so that you can focus on your work.

Even after weeks or months, the count is kept while in deep sleep mode.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Count up/down and show it on screen
- [ ] enable/disable sound when pressing buttons
- [ ] Low Power Consumption
    - [ ] Lower the frequency of the microcontroller at minimum
    - [ ] Enter deep sleep mode automatically

See the [open issues](https://github.com/makingdevices/Bytes-Counter/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

State: Project FINISHED
